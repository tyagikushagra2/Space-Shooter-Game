# Space-Shooter-Game
A space shooter game using pure C++ logics
Using simple logics of loops, arrays, classes, and concepts of OOPs, I made different algorithms for shooting, moving, score counting, enemies A.I. etc.
So this actually shows that you can build complex things by using simple knowledge of C++.
