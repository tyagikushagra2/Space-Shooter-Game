# Space-Shooter-Game
A space shooter game using pure C++ logics
Source code is in pdf file uploaded. Just copy and paste it on Visual Studio and play it.
Using simple logics of loops, arrays, classes, and concepts of OOPs, I made different algorithms for shooting, moving, score counting, enemies A.I. etc.
So this actually shows that you can build complex things by using simple knowledge of C++.

A- Move Left
D- Move right
Z- Fire
P- Pause
